Week 3: starting the basis of the application: making algorithm tests.
Annie: Building the backbone of the program (make sure that the hardware runs properly)
Jessica: Programming the algorithm (using all 3 computers)
Bill: Test the efficacy of different algorithms, making sure that we use the most efficient algorithm (least amount of memory storage for learning and has the max depth).
Week 4: Server development
Annie: Importing the data to the server
Jessica: Developing the server (hardware-wise)
Bill: Building the server environment and making sure that everything works.
Week 5: Web development
Annie: coding the web interface
Jessica: designing the website.
Bill: maintaining the website (make sure that the server and the website fits properly)
Week 6: Finalizing Application
Annie: building the link between app, web, and server
Jessica: importing the data between app, web, and server
